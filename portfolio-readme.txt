Julianna Chianelli - Coding practice portfolio

Hello! This is a website used to document daily coding exercises that I will
be working on for 180 days. Ideally, this will be 180 consecutive days where I
will practice and showcase what I've learned using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery,
Bootstrap, and various other languages and frameworks.


Here is what my website is currently built with:

HTML
CSS
